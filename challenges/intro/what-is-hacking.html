        <p>This website aims to teach you the basics of ethical hacking.
        But what is hacking? And why is it something you should learn?<br><br>
        <strong>Hacking</strong> is the process of finding loopholes (called <em>exploits</em>) in the rules of a system, and using them
        to achieve some kind of goal, often gaining unauthorized access. <br>
        <strong>Ethical Hacking</strong> is the process of finding those exploits
        not to attack the system, but to discover security flaws and protect the system. This is very common in the field of cyber
        security<br><br>
        Knowing how to hack is an invaluable skill in the 21st century, when so much of our lives are online or digital.
        If you know how to hack you know what kind of risks you face online, and what you can do to protect yourself and those around you.
        The cybersecurity field is also a thriving field that will only continue to grow as more and more of the world is digitized.<br><br>
